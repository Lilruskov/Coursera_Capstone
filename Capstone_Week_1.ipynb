Next, we will convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. Also, we will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in York and we will use the **explore** function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. You will use the *k*-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, you will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in York and their emerging clusters."
